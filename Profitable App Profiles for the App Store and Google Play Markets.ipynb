    "In this project, we want to analyze the datasets from the Android and iOS app stores. Our goal is to understand what type of free apps are likely to attract the most users and monetize it. Lets pretend I work for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps that are free to download and install. Our main source of revenue consists of in-app advertisements. This means our revenue is directly correlated to how popular the app is among users. \n",

    "My goal is to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract the most users. In order to do this, we have outlined a 3-step strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.\n",
    "2. If there is enough positive response from users, we develop it further.\n",
    "3. If the app is profitable after six months, we build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play."
